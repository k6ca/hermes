Hermes Empreendimentos e Administração Ltda.
Originally, the company had a website to advertise its properties, developed in WordPress in 2016. The website had some plugins, which over the years were discontinued by their creators, creating a problem for the website to function correctly.
In 2023, the problems have become enormous. Some improper redirections were occurring due to a lack of plugin updates or even weaknesses in the WordPress construction method.
